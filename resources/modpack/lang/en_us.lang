tc.research_category.SKILLS=Types of Magic

research.skills.base.2=There are many types of magic in this world. A long time ago, witches decided to name the five major types - Cosmomancy, Hemomancy, Druidry, Brewing and (magical) Tinkering. Each one focuses on a different aspect and usage of magic.
research.skills.cosmomancy.1=Cosmomancy is a rather powerful category of magic. Its main focus is manipulating time and space, creating worlds and traveling between the bounds of reality. It takes a long time and a powerful mind to master.
research.skills.hemomancy.1=Hemomancy has its roots not only in magic but in mortal sciencees as well, mainly medicine. This type of magic focuses on working with the life and death of organisms which have blood in them. In some places, hemomancy is considered taboo due to tendency to mingle with the dead.
research.skills.druidry.1=Druidry has similar roots to hemomancy but instead of animal life, it works with plant life and it is a much more peaceful practice. This type of magic specializes in the production of resources and temporary empowering one's self.
research.skills.brewing.1=Brewing is the art of mixing together the right ingredients in order to produce powerful potions, capable of a variaty of things. This is a rather commom type of magic, well suited for those who wish to make a profit from their skill or like experimenting.
research.skills.tinkering.1=Out of all types of magic, tinkering is the closest one to being a mundane practice. Tinkering is the art of  making powerful tools from a variety of metals. Magical tinkering however specializes in the usage of magical materials instead of common ones.
